# Prework Study Guide Web App

## Decription 

- My main motivation for completing this Web app was to start to familiarize myself with the different tools and languages I'll be using in the Bootcamp moving forward and to really take advantage of the learning oportunity here to soak up as much as I could so I can hit the ground running when the bootcamp starts!
- I built this project to practice writing code in the different coding languages we will be using in the bootcamp and familiarize myself with the yntax and the different workflows of each, and to start to get good productivity and organization habits in place for the bootcamp.
- This solves the problem of constantly having to go back and find the right lessons and modules that have the specific info I'm looking for in regards to study material, I can have it all in one place now.
- I learned a ton! I learned the basics of the Git workflow, and how to navigate in the terminal, as well as some of the basic tenants of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as coding languages.  I learned about how to link different features of my web app to each other and commit those changes and save them in a github repository. I also learned a little about Chrome DevTools!

## Usage

The website is pretty basic but functions in the way it was intended. I have a list of different topics that each have lists of notes underneath them such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open Chrome DevTools, you can see the JavaScript logic I wrote in action.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
